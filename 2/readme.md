Project Euler: Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed n, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

fiboEvenSum(10) should return a number.
fiboEvenSum(10) should return 10.
fiboEvenSum(60) should return 44.
fiboEvenSum(1000) should return 798.
fiboEvenSum(100000) should return 60696.
fiboEvenSum(4000000) should return 4613732.
Your function should return an even value.
